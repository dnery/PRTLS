A little arcade-style navigation game written in assembly language for the [ICMC
processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC). Run over the bad guys
with your green ship as they pop up! There are instructions for mounting and
simulating programs in the ICMC processor project repo. The `charmap.mif`
available in the repo should be used, also, when putting up the simulation.
Otherwise stuff is gonna look weird...
